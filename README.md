# Happy Thoughts [View Live &#10555;](https://dontworry-behappy.netlify.app/)

In this project I have created a "twitter-like" app which is fetching and posting data to an API, using useState and useEffect.

## The problem

I started off by building the two components and then added code to follow instructions and fulfill requirements, the app should:
  ➖ Have a form to post new thoughts
  ➖ Show all the written me and how many likes it has recieved. List the latest message on top, oldest in the bottom (sorted).
  ➖ Add a heart-button for users to send likes on each thought. The colour of the button should vary depending on if it has got any likes or not.
  ➖ Should follow a given design.
  ➖ I also made a counter for letters written in the form.

 Next steps would be:
  ➖ Create warning if the message written in the form is too long.
  ➖ Error-message if sent message is too long/ short/ empty (friendly message).
  ➖ Create Handle loading states
  ➖ Cunter for how many different posts you have liked 
  ➖ Animation for new thought added
