# Happy Thoughts [View Live &#10555;](https://dontworry-behappy.netlify.app/)

In this project I have created a "twitter-like" app in React which is fetching and posting data to an API, using useState and useEffect.

## The problem

I started off by building the two components with API and then added code according to instructions and requirements:
  * Made a form to post new thoughts.
  * Made the app show all the written messages and how many likes each has recieved.
  * Listed the latest message on top, oldest in the bottom (sorted).
  * Created a heart-button for users to send likes on each thought.
  * Made the colour of the button vary depending on if it has got any likes or not.
  * Followed a given design-guideline.

  * I also made a counter for letters written in the form.

 Next steps would be:
  * Create warning if the message written in the form is too long.
  * Error-message if sent message is too long/ short/ empty (friendly message).
  * Create Handle loading states
  * Cunter for how many different posts you have liked 
  * Animation for new thought added

## TECH used:
 * React
 * useEffect hook
 * useState hook
 * Fetch
 * Postman
 * CSS
